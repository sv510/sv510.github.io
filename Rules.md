---

- Use of symbols is prohibited (Judges decision on what is allowed is final)
- Labeling axes in graphs is prohibited
- Format followed: Single elimination tournament
	- A single-elimination, knockout, or sudden death tournament is a type of elimination tournament where the loser of each match-up is immediately eliminated from the tournament. Each winner will play another in the next round, until the final match-up, whose winner becomes the tournament champion
- Before the start of each round, one of each team responsible for drawing or acting the given phrase decide on the medium of expression by a consensus. This process must end with a conclusion within thirty-five seconds
	- The expressors can negotiate to provide the opponent with a head start of $5n$ seconds where $n = \set{1,2,3,4,5,6}$, but only one team can have a head start
	- Failure to reach a conclusion within the stipulated time, will result in judges choosing the medium of expression for that round
- Each team is warned three times for violating the rules (decided by the judges) after which the team is eliminated and the opponent team is promoted to the next round
- In the case of no team arriving at the right answer after 10 minutes of game time in a round, a coin is flipped to decide which team moves to the next round
